## What is Git

## The Structure of Git

When working with git in your day to day it's useful to know about the way git is structured. There are four main working areas that you'll be using when working with git. These four areas are

- The Working Directory
- The Staging Area (Also know as the index)
- The Local Repository
- The Remote Repository

The further down the above list you go the less control you have over changes to indivdual files and the more control git has.
Lets look at each of these areas together now.

### The Working Directory

The working directory is where you make all your changes. It is the directory which is under version control using git. You have the most control over this area and can make changes using editors without ever typing a single git command. While there are git commands that can make changes in this area, git commands are not the only way unlike the next area.

### The Staging Area (Also know as the index)

The Staging Area or Index is where you stage your changes to your working directory ready to be put under git's full control. This is the area between you and your local repository. The main purpose of this area is to help you organise how you label the changes you wish to put under git's full control. You will also see this area come into play a lot when you have conflicts between changes. You can only make changes here using git commands, but you have still have control over what goes under git's full control.

### The Local Repository

The Local Repository is what allows git to be distributed. You have your own local copy of the reposity that you can control with git commands. Once you have put changes into the local repository you cannot edit them easily. It is possible, but you can only really edit blocks of changes that were made in the staging area prevously.

Also the Local Repository can be seen a little bit like a staging area for the remote repository.

### The Remote Repository

The remote repository is the area that everyone on your team and the outside world can see your changes. You can think of the remote repository as the perfect copy of your code (The good enough to ship version). As such you tend to have less control over this area. It is possible to have more than one remote repository in your project, but most likely you'll only ever work with one.

## Working locally

It is possible to work with git without having a remote repository at all. For this first section that is exactly what we will do.
The reason for this is so we can just think about the interaction between the first three areas, and since this is what you will most likely be doing mostly, it's a good place to start and for you to get some practice.

### Initilising your Local Repository

The first thing you will want to do is identify the directory you want to put under version control. This directory is your working directory as mentioned before as one of the working areas in git. This directory can be empty or can already contain files. In your terminal either create or navigate to the directory you wish to put under version control. You can do this by using the `cd` and `mkdir` commands if using a bash shell.

Once your terminal is in your directory, you can use the following command to create your local repository.

```git init```

That is it. You now have a local reposity you can work with. This repository is currently empty and knows nothing about the files you might already have in your working directory. Additionaly your staging are is also empty.
